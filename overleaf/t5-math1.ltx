In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated 
by the equation $E=mc^2$, discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.

\begin{math}
E=mc^2
\end{math} is typeset in a paragraph using inline math mode---as is
$E=mc^2$, and so too is \(E=mc^2\).

The mass-energy equivalence is described by the famous equation
\[ E=mc^2 \] discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein. 

In natural units ($c = 1$), the formula expresses the identity
\begin{equation}
E=m
\end{equation}
